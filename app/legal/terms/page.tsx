                <P>By accessing and using Wisp AI ("the Service"), operated by Wisp Studios ("we", "us", or "our"), you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree to these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this Service.</P>
                <P>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Wisp Studios regarding your use of the Service, and supersede any prior agreements. We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time by posting an updated version. We will notify users of significant changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</P>

              <Section id="description" title="2. Description of Service">
                <P>Wisp AI is an AI-powered development tool that generates Roblox Luau scripts, systems, UI components, and game instances based on natural language prompts. The Service is accessible through our web dashboard at dash.wisp.lol, our Roblox Studio plugin, and our browser-based chat interface — and is intended for use by Roblox developers of all skill levels.</P>
                <P>The Service connects to your Roblox account via OAuth2, syncs your game's hierarchy from Studio, and delivers generated output directly into your project through the Wisp plugin. Additional features include project management, version history, heartbeat-based session tracking, and collaborative tools. We reserve the right to modify, expand, suspend, or discontinue any feature or the Service in its entirety at any time, with or without notice.</P>
              </Section>

              <Section id="eligibility" title="3. Eligibility">
                <P>You must be at least 13 years of age to use Wisp AI. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.</P>
                <P>By using the Service, you represent and warrant that: (a) you have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement; (b) you are not barred from receiving services under any applicable law; and (c) all registration information you provide is accurate and current. We reserve the right to deny access to any person or entity at our sole discretion.</P>

                <P>To use Wisp AI, you must authenticate via Roblox OAuth2 through our authorization flow at dash.wisp.lol. By connecting your Roblox account, you authorize us to access your public profile information including your username, display name, user ID, and avatar image. We do not access your Roblox inventory, Robux balance, private messages, or any private account data beyond what is explicitly requested.</P>
                <P>Upon successful authorization, a secure token is issued and stored locally in your Roblox Studio plugin settings. This token is used to authenticate all subsequent API calls including project fetching, output polling, heartbeat pings, and game model uploads. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of this token and your account credentials.</P>
                <P>You may not share your account, allow others to access the Service through your account, or create multiple accounts to circumvent usage limits or restrictions. We reserve the right to revoke tokens and suspend or terminate accounts that violate these provisions.</P>

By subscribing to a paid plan, you agree to pay all applicable fees as described on our pricing page at the time of your subscription.</P>
                <P>Subscription fees are billed in advance on a recurring basis (monthly or annually, as selected).

By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your data as described in the Privacy Policy.</P>
                <P>When you use the Studio plugin, Wisp AI scans and uploads your game's service hierarchy — including script names, class names, folder structures, and source code — to our servers. This data is used solely to provide context to the AI for better code generation. We do not share this game data with third parties.</P>
                <P>You retain ownership of your prompts, game data, and project inputs. By submitting content, you grant Wisp Studios a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to process your inputs solely for the purpose of delivering and improving the Service. We do not sell your personal data.</P>

              <Section id="third-party" title="10. Third-Party Services">
                <P>The Service integrates with third-party platforms including Roblox (for authentication and avatar data), payment processors (for billing), and infrastructure providers. These services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies, and Wisp Studios is not responsible for their content, availability, or practices.</P>
                <P>The Wisp Studio plugin makes HTTP requests to our API endpoints. Your use of the plugin requires that HTTP Requests are enabled in your Roblox Studio game settings. We are not responsible for network errors, Roblox API changes, or plugin behavior resulting from Roblox platform updates.</P>
              </Section>

              <Section id="plugin" title="11. Studio Plugin">
                <P>The Wisp AI Studio plugin ("the Plugin") is a Roblox Studio tool that connects to our Service, scans your game hierarchy, polls for new generated output, and automatically inserts scripts and instances into your project. The Plugin communicates with our servers at intervals defined by its polling (every 10 seconds), heartbeat (every 15 seconds), and auto-scan (every 60 seconds) cycles.</P>
                <P>By installing and using the Plugin, you acknowledge that it will: (a) send your game's service tree structure and source code to our servers; (b) store a session token in your Studio plugin settings; (c) automatically insert, update, or overwrite scripts and instances in your project when new output is available; and (d) send your Roblox user ID to associate your Studio session with your Wisp account.</P>
                <P>You are responsible for reviewing all code inserted by the Plugin before publishing your experience. Wisp Studios is not liable for any damage, data loss, or policy violations arising from auto-inserted content.</P>

                <P>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at our sole discretion, with or without notice, for any reason — including violation of these Terms, harmful conduct, extended inactivity, or discontinuation of the Service. Token revocation takes effect immediately and will cause the Studio plugin to require re-authorization.</P>
                <P>You may terminate your account at any time through your dashboard or by contacting us. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases immediately. Provisions that by their nature survive termination — including intellectual property rights, disclaimers, liability limitations, and indemnification — shall remain in effect.</P>
